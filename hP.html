        The Human Practice group coordinated with individuals in and out of our
        team. The human practice reached out to specialists and professionals to
        gain more insights into probiotics and vitamin D for our project.
        <br />
        <br />
        We started off with a public opinion survey to investigate people’s
        current understanding of vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency in order to
        gain feedback on our project. The Human Practice team also arranged
        several educational forums where we presented to a wide range of
        audiences about the importance of vitamin D. According to our survey,
        very few people are aware of the importance of vitamin D. Therefore, we
        posted several posts on Instagram about vitamins in hopes to reach a
        larger audience to educate. Currently, Tik-Tok is a rising social media
        platform where people all around the world are using. Therefore, we
        decided to spread the importance of vitamin D by filming short
        educational videos on tik tok!

        In June, we made a survey to collect data on the demand for our product
        and the public’s knowledge on vitamin D deficiency. The survey was sent
        out to different regions around the world, including Asia, North
        America, Europe, etc. We post an Instagram story to announce the survey
        and post the link in our account profile to welcome everyone to fill it
        out for us. Our members also sent it to our classmates, teachers, and
        relatives in different countries, asking them to share the survey to
        people around them. We received a total of 1355 anonymous responses in
        12 days and collected the data in the following graph below.
        <br />
        <br />
        The majority of our participants’ ages lie between 18 to 55, and only
        some participants are 0~17 years old or 56~75 years old. More than half
        of our participants(63.8%) are female, while the rest 35.5% being males
        and 0.7% of participants who are unable to disclose. As all of our team
        members are from Taiwan, we lived in a Taiwanese community. Thus, the
        majority of our participants currently live in Taiwan as well, the
        survey results are more likely to reflect the situation in Taiwan.

        Most of our participants (74.2%) responded that they are aware of their
        vitamin D intake, and know vitamin D is essential for their health.
        However, due to the pandemic, people tend to have fewer chances to go
        outdoors. Out of 1355 responses, 71.2% of the participants spent less
        than 3 day outdoors within the past 2 weeks, indicating how people have
        less exposure to sunlight, a vital source of vitamin D. Our survey also
        shows 36.0% of the participants rely on sunlight as their main vitamin D
        source; 18.3% of the participants, on the other hand, are unclear on how
        they receive vitamin D on a daily basis.

        Fermented foods are habitually eaten around the world. In Asia, there is
        kimchi for Korean, and miso for Japanese, while in western countries
        there is Greek yogurt for Greece, and pickles in America. Our survey
        reassured our assumption that fermented food is consumed on a global
        scale. More than half of the participants (51.5%) eat more than one kind
        of fermented food on a daily basis. The internationally spread culture

      <article class="HPText">
        Through our interview with Dr. Edward Huang, MD, MPH, we learned
        valuable knowledge regarding probiotics, a key aspect of our project. We
        learned that in general, it takes 3 years for bacteria to reach a mature
        state in which the gut microbiome remains constant. Dr. Huang stated how
        the types of bacteria in one’s microbiome vary according to geographical
        location. For example, the microbiome of someone who lives in Uganda
        would look different from that of someone who lives in the United
        States. Furthermore, suggested probiotic intake depends on the treatment
        or disease of that patient. People should take probiotics regularly in
        order to maintain the positive benefits as most probiotic strains last
        1-4 weeks in the GI tract after their consumption. In fact, when
        determining gut microbiome makeup, we can measure the amount from stool.
        Also, butyrate is found in stool since it is a short chain fatty acid
        which is the energy substrate for the whole colon. Finally, Dr. Huang
        concluded that our project solution is very interesting since utilizing
        probiotics to treat vitamin D deficiency is not a current strategy. He
        also informed us on the health issues that we should consider for our
        project. For example, if butyrate is being overexpressed then it can
        cause the bacteria to die or proliferate less.

        Michael Holick, Ph.D., M.D, a professor specializing in fields of
        medicine, physiology, and biophysics, has changed the old understanding
        of vitamin D. His work includes several papers regarding the topic of
        vitamin D, such as reemphasizing on the issue of vitamin D deficiency,
        warning against dangers of lacking sunlight exposure, and isolating
        active forms of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D (Holick Receives Linus Pauling
        Prize for Health Research, 2009).
      </figcaption>
      <article class="HPText">
        After our interview with Dr. Holick, we gained a deeper insight into our
        project. According to Dr. Holick, most probiotics reside in the GI
        system, including the ileum, jejunum, and colon. Yet, as 1,25(OH)2D
        functions in the duodenum, the butyrate and VDR produced by engineered
        probiotics therefore, might not end up increasing activation efficiency
        of vitamin D as it is more likely to reside in a different place in the
        human body. Furthermore, unlike 25(OH)D that can be produced locally,
        1,25(OH)2D is only synthesized in the kidneys raising another question
        mark towards our project’s feasibility. Through the interview, Dr.
        Holick also stated how while our project does consist of clever
        concepts, it does not cure the root cause of vitamin D deficiency as it
        only solves calcium absorption issues. This interview with Dr. Michael
        F. Holick brought our team new perspectives on the topic of vitamin D
        deficiency and raised new questions we need to explore further.

        Butyrate increases Vitamin D Receptor expression level in a time and

        Joseph L. Napoli, Ph.D., a professor under the department of nutritional
        sciences & toxicology at University of California Berkeley, has done
        research in metabolism, fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin D, and vitamin A.
        He has done research on the topic of vitamin D throughout his career.

        In the interview with Dr. Napoli, we confirmed on, discovered errors in,
        and gained deeper insights for our original research. Firstly, Dr.
        Napoli mentioned that the issue of overdose of vitamin D is
        overexaggerated and rarely happens in real life. As Dr. Napoli stated,
        1,25(OH)2D induces the transcription of certain genes. Yet, as soon as
        transcription starts, a specific gene is expressed to inactivate
        1,25(OH)2D. This helps the ethical and safety aspect of our final
        product of fermentation starter as we do not need to stress too much
        about problems with overexpressing vitamin D. Secondly, we realized a
        greater issue is that overproduction of calcium contributes to causes of
        gastric reflux diseases, kidney stones, and other diseases. Thirdly, we
        were able to get confirmation that sunlight and food products have no
        sufficient amounts of vitamin D the human body requires for proper
        regulations. Lastly, new questions arose about the metabolic pathways
        set up for our probiotic, the survival conditions of probiotics, the
        butyrate dose response curve, butyrate dosage, and certain safety
        margins we must consider for our project. By having this interview with
        Dr. Joseph L. Napoli, it allowed us to get one step closer to a more
        feasible project as we will continue to build on the research based on
        feedback given.

        Does VDR increase impact on signalling?
        <br />
        Vitamin D is either activated by vitamin D receptors (VDR) or by
        heterodimers consisting of VDR and the retinoid-X-receptor-α
        (RXR-α)(Carlberg et al., 1993). All the genomic actions of 1, 25(OH)2D
        all are controlled by and dependent on transcription factor vitamin D
        receptors (VDR). Therefore, the signalling for any vitamin D most likely
        suggests molecular actions of VDR in the human body (Carlberg &
        Campbell, 2013).

      <div class="HPHeading2">Conclusion</div>
      <article class="HPText">
        Looking at all three interviews, not only did we gain professional
        feedback from different doctors specializing in different fields, but
        also gained more insight into probiotics, Vitamin D, and VDR. By
        connecting different information collected from the interviews, our team
        had a better understanding of how our project will process and what we
        need to improve on for a better solution to vitamin D deficiency.
