                The Human Practice group coordinated with individuals in and out
                of our team. The human practice reached out to specialists and
                professionals to gain more insights into probiotics and vitamin
                D for our project.
                <br />
                <br />
                We started off with a public opinion survey to investigate
                people’s current understanding of vitamin D and vitamin D
                deficiency in order to gain feedback on our project.
                The Human Practice team also arranged several educational forums
                where we presented to a wide range of audiences about the
                importance of vitamin D. According to our survey, very few
                people are aware of the importance of vitamin D.
                Therefore, we posted several posts on Instagram about vitamins
                in hopes to reach a larger audience to educate. Currently,
                Tik-Tok is a rising social media platform where people all
                around the world are using. Therefore, we decided to spread the
                importance of vitamin D by filming short educational videos on
                tik tok!

            <article class="HPText">
                In June, we made a survey to collect data on the demand for our
                product and the public’s knowledge on vitamin D deficiency. The
                survey was sent out to different regions around the world,
                including Asia, North America, Europe, etc. We post an Instagram
                story to announce the survey and post the link in our account
                profile to welcome everyone to fill it out for us. Our members
                also sent it to our classmates, teachers, and relatives in
                different countries, asking them to share the survey to people
                around them. We received a total of 1355 anonymous responses in
                12 days and collected the data in the following graph below.
                <br />
                <br />
                The majority of our participants’ ages lie between 18 to 55, and
                only some participants are 0~17 years old or 56~75 years old.
                More than half of our participants(63.8%) are female, while the
                rest 35.5% being males and 0.7% of participants who are unable
                to disclose. As all of our team members are from Taiwan, we
                lived in a Taiwanese community. Thus, the majority of our
                participants currently live in Taiwan as well, the survey
                results are more likely to reflect the situation in Taiwan.

                Most of our participants (74.2%) responded that they are aware
                of their vitamin D intake, and know vitamin D is essential for
                their health. However, due to the pandemic, people tend to have
                fewer chances to go outdoors. Out of 1355 responses, 71.2% of
                the participants spent less than 3 day outdoors within the past
                2 weeks, indicating how people have less exposure to sunlight, a
                vital source of vitamin D. Our survey also shows 36.0% of the
                participants rely on sunlight as their main vitamin D source;
                18.3% of the participants, on the other hand, are unclear on how
                they receive vitamin D on a daily basis.

                While most individuals take vitamin D on a regular basis, 58.9%
                of people are not sure whether or not supplements work, and only
                26.6% of them think it does make a difference. We can infer from
                the results how a majority of individuals are unsure about
                vitamin D supplements’ utility, proving the necessity of our
                product. Since our product can be seamlessly incorporated into
                people’s daily diets, it can have a much greater impact than
                supplements and other current solutions.

                86.9% of communities acknowledge vitamin D deficiency as a
                serious problem.
                For the following question in the survey, we asked for a free
                response answer on why vitamin D is a problem. Out of 1355
                responses, more than half (51.7%) are unsure, while 43.3% focus
                on its negative impacts on bone growth.

                Fermented foods are habitually eaten around the world. In Asia,
                there is kimchi for Korean, and miso for Japanese, while in
                western countries there is Greek yogurt for Greece, and pickles
                in America. Our survey reassured our assumption that fermented
                food is consumed on a global scale. More than half of the
                participants (51.5%) eat more than one kind of fermented food on
                a daily basis. The internationally spread culture assists our
                product to be used world-widely, helping to prevent the patient
                of vitamin D deficiency effectively.

                In the survey, 28.7% of the population ate fermented products
                for more than one meal a week, while another 20.2% ate these
                products for more than four meals a week. Although 48.7% of them
                consume one meal or less of fermented food within a week, we
                still see most of all the participants take fermentation food as
                part of their diets.

                most of the population claim they need more information before

                In our survey, 86.8% of the population agreed on the severity of
                vitamin D deficiency in regards to human health. But on the
                follow-up question, 51.7% were unsure, suggesting that the
                majority of individuals are still not sure what Vitamin D
                deficiency is and why it is an issue. Realizing this, our
                education plan aims to increase public awareness on the
