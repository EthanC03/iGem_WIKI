        <article class="impText">
          Fermentation is one of the methods by which cells generate energy and
          maintain redox balance in anoxic environments (Catalanotti et al.,
          2013). Yeasts and lactic acid bacteria play crucial roles in the
          metabolism of alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation
          respectively, in which a carbohydrate is converted into an alcohol or
          an acid (Maicas, 2020) (National Research Council (US) Panel on the
          Applications of Biotechnology to Traditional Fermented Foods, 1992).
          Fermentation increases acid and alcohol content and decreases water,
          inhibiting the growth of spoilage microorganisms by creating a harsh
          environment difficult for their survival. Therefore, the yeasts and
          lactic acid bacteria are employed by people worldwide to preserve and
          produce food including wine and beer as well as pickles, yogurts, and
          kimchi.
          <br />
          <br />
          The process of fermentation varies for different fermented foods.
          Fermentation processes of vegetables, including dill pickles and
          sauerkraut, can be conducted by dry salting or brining, whereas
          products such as yogurt and kombucha require the addition of starter
          culture to the food materials. However, our D-licious fermentation
          starter can be added to both kinds of fermentation food to increase
          the growth of certain target bacteria (Downshiftology, 2019).
          <br />
          <br />
          Fermentation starters are bases used during the commercial production
          of some fermented foods to ensure the consistency in properties of the
          products, including the acidity and aroma. The microbial cultures
          consist of specific cultivation media and a specific mix of essential
          microorganisms that would be inoculated to perform the fermenting
          process (Starter Culture - an Overview | ScienceDirect Topics, 2017).
          The fermentation starters of our products would be in the form of
          powder. The manufacture of them starts with heat treatment of the
          medium, in which the original microorganisms and the dissolved oxygen
          are eliminated. The specific bacteria culture is then inoculated to
          the heated-treated media cooled down to a suitable temperature for
          bacteria growth. During incubation, the bacteria multiply and perform
          the process of fermentation until the starter culture is cooled down
          to inhibit further growth, which helps maintain the high activity of
          the bacteria. Finally, with methods such as freezing, the starters are
          preserved for storage (CULTURES AND STARTER MANUFACTURE, 2019).

          The D-licious fermentation kit includes tools and recipes for homemade
          fermentation food along with a powdered fermentation starter

          <br />
          Several tools are included in the D-Licious fermentation kit to assist
          fermentation processes at home, including fermentation jars, a
          pounding tool/tamper, waterless airlock tops, glass, weights, and
          recipes. The fermentation jars provide containers of food materials in
          which the probiotics in the starter perform the fermentation process.
          The pounding tool helps to crush large food materials such as
          cucumbers into smaller pieces. The airlock, which should be attached
          to the glass and the lid, maintains an anaerobic atmosphere for
          fermentation, preventing the air from entering the jars while allowing
          the release of CO2 generated during fermentation. The weights help
          hold the food in place during the fermentation process. To suit the
          preference of each user, we also include the details of the steps for
          making each specific fermented food (yogurt, pickles, and kimchi) in
          the recipes.

          To utilize the D-Licious fermentation starter, users can start with
          the preparation of food materials, of which the process would vary
          with the type of food. Specifically, milk would be heated and
          vegetables would be sliced into appropriate pieces. After setting the
          materials to the temperature suitable for the growth of bacteria, the
          fermentation starter could be added (along with salt/ saltwater in
          terms of vegetable food materials) and left for incubation. Finally,
          the fermented food could be frozen for preservation.

        <div class="impHeading1">Taiwanese Local Target Users</div>
        <article class="impText">
          Vitamin D deficiency is a serious health issue around the world;
          Taiwan is one of the countries most significantly impacted. According
          to a survey conducted by Chang Gung Memorial Hospital that examines
          the 25(OH)D levels of a total of 3954 individuals, despite the high
          level of sunlight expected in subtropical regions, vitamin D
          deficiency is prevalent in Taiwan. Specifically, in urban areas of
          northern Taiwan, behavior factors such as the tendency to stay indoors
          for work, the application of makeup on the skin, and the increasing
          air pollution limit people’s exposure to sunlight, resulting in a
          higher vitamin D deficiency prevalence rate of 22.4% (25(OH)-D
          concentration < 20 ng/mL) (Lee et al. 2019). The issue could
          potentially worsen due to the recent COVID-19 lockdown, which has
          prevented people from outdoor activities. The decrease in exposure to
          sunlight might cause a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency in
          Taiwanese. Therefore, our product is especially suitable for local
          citizens under these circumstances.

        <div class="impHeading1">Global General Target Users</div>
        <article class="impText">
          <em>Infants and Toddlers (6 months~3 years old)</em>
          <br />
          An urban primary care clinical study measured the prevalence rate of
          vitamin D deficiency among 365 healthy infants and toddlers, the
          results were shocking. Out of all participants, 52.1% were shown to
          have levels of vitamin D below the accepted optimal threshold (Gordon
          et al., 2008). From this, we see that newborn babies to toddlers up to
          3 years of age are all high-risk groups for vitamin D deficiency.
          Although breast milk provides a blend of vitamins, proteins, and fat,
          the amount of vitamin D in breast milk is far less than the minimum
          required for a healthy infant (Breastmilk information, 2021). Also,
          the nutrition of breast milk depends on the mother’s condition,
          therefore vitamin D levels in the milk of deficient individuals are
          further reduced. The infant or toddler, therefore, requires to intake
          extra amounts of vitamin D from other food sources which generally
          have minimal levels of vitamin D compared to supplements or sunlight
          (CDC, 2019). Vitamin D limitations in food sources as well as infants’
          lack of sunlight exposure all contribute to their development of
          rickets, muscle weakness, and fractures (Canadian Paediatric Society,
          2021). Considering how deficient amounts of vitamin D hinder infants
          and toddlers’ motor development and put them at risk of vitamin D
          related diseases, we decided to target infants from 6 months (can
          start yogurt intake in small quantities) up to toddlers of 3 years old
          (Can Babies Have Yogurt: Answers for Parents, 2018).
          <br />
          <em>Older Adults/Seniors</em>
          <br />
          According to a study in Singapore, out of 134 subjects ( ≥ 65 years
          old), 115 patients (85.6%) presented low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
          (25OHD3) levels. Another clinical report has also shown that out of
          217 consecutively geriatric hospitalized patients, approximately 96%
          of all have serum 25(OH)D below the optimal concentrations of ≥30
          ng/ml (Boettger et al., 2018). Risk factors for the elderlys’ vitamin
          D deficiency issues include decreased VDR expression, decreased
          vitamin D production in the skin, decreased kidney function for
          1,25(OH)2D production, and several others. In older individuals, aging
          results in lower vitamin D production in the human skin due to the
          decrease in 7-DHC which further slows down the response to UVB rays
          when exposed to sunlight. When a person ages, renal functions decline
          as well, leading to decreased activity of renal enzymes, such as 1α
          hydroxylase that converts 25OHD into 1,25(OH)2D. Moreover, ones with
          age ≥80 often have glomerular function rates (GFR) under 50 mL/min,
          highly lowering the production of 1,25(OH)2D levels. While these all
          have major contributions to relationships between aging and vitamin D
          deficiency, substrate deficiency also plays a significant role in
          vitamin D deficiency in seniors. This type of deficiency is caused by
          the diet or lack of sunlight exposure, decreasing 25(OH)D that limits
          1,25(OH)2D production (Gallagher, 2013). Due to all factors above,
          seniors are especially at risk with vitamin D deficiency, and can
          therefore be listed as one of the main target users for our engineered
          fermentation starter.
          <br />
          <em>Individuals with Darker Skin</em>
          <br />
          Skin color has high biological significance and is associated with the
          regulation of Vitamin D in human bodies. Individuals with darker skin
          have higher risks of vitamin D deficiency as well. According to the
          Division of Health Equities at Beckman Research Institute of City of
          Hope, about 70% of African Americans suffer from vitamin D deficiency,
          causing them to be more vulnerable to cancer and cardiovascular
          diseases than people with lighter skin tone. The pigmentation causing
          the darker skin tone is a natural barrier against the UV light
          penetrating through the skin. Specifically, the large amounts of
          melanin, which is responsible for the tanning of the skin, in the
          epidermal layer undermine the skin’s ability to absorb sunlight and
          produce vitamin D. Furthermore, scientists also found that three
          regions of genes in African Americans that associate with the
          regulation of skin pigmentation also has a strong connection to
          vitamin D deficiency, therefore leading to the requirement of more
          intense sunlight exposure to synthesize sufficient amounts of Vitamin
          D. As a result, Individuals with darker skin tone are the potential
          target users for our products.
          <br />
          <em>Obese Individuals</em>
          <br />
          Obesity, a chronic health condition, has displayed strong bonds with
          vitamin D deficiency. Recent reports revealed prevalence rates of
          vitamin D deficiency in the obese population of up to 90% (UC Health).
          Studies have revealed that increasing BMI and body fat is associated
          with lower 25(OH)D concentrations, high PTH (parathyroid hormone)
          concentrations, and low 1,25(OH)2D levels (Vanlint, 2013). Reasons for
          connections between vitamin D deficiency and obesity may be due to
          obese individual’s lower participation in outdoor activities, leading
          to minimal sunlight exposure. Other scientific theories also suggest
          how obese subjects experienced lower increases in plasma levels of
          25(OH)D after oral supplementation or exposure to UVB rays because of
          vitamin D distributing into excessive amounts of adipose tissues (AT)
          which are responsible for accumulating and retaining fat-soluble
          vitamins. Furthermore, several also pointed out possible correlations
          of impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation with lower 25(OH)D
          concentrations. As one common chronic liver disease in obesity,
          non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been found to be
          responsible for causing liver cirrhosis, causing the damage,
          inflammation, or necrosis in the liver which may also contribute to
          low 25(OH)D. While the reasons for associations between obesity and
          vitamin D remain unclear, there is no doubt about a cause-effect
          relationship between the two (Vranić et al., 2019).
