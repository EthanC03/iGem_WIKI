            After confirming the engineering of our DNA constructs, we further prove that our project is likely to work
            in a relevant context. We confirmed the expression of our target protein beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
            dehydrogenase with SDS-PAGE and planned further experiments to test the increase of butyrate production and
            the upregulation of Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) expression by butyrate.

            *Fig.1 The SDS-PAGE result shows that our HBD protein is overexpressed in induced cells colony 1 (Q1),
            colony 2 (Q2), and colony 3 (Q3)

            Found via RCSB Protein Data Bank, the size of beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase is determined to be
            37kDa. We picked 3 colonies and ran SDS-PAGE with Tris-Glycerin 4-20% as the marker; each colony was grown
            under both induced and uninduced conditions. Uninduce colony has its repressor attached to the operator,
            therefore transcription will not occur; on the other hand, induced colonies by IPTG, the repressor will fall
            off from the operator, therefore the gene will be properly expressed by the polymerase. According to figure
            1, HBD protein is overexpressed in induced cells colony 1 (Q1), colony 2 (Q2). However, the OD 600 result
            shows that the Q3 has low bacteria density. Due to the lack of concentration of colony 3 (Q3), its protein
            expression isn’t as obvious as Q1 and Q2.

        <div class="proofContent">
            To ensure the feasibility of our project, we planned to prove the HBD and BCD proteins’ enhancement of
            butyrate synthesis by testing both rate-limiting steps.
            We first added a fixed amount of acetyl-CoA and NADH for the testing of HBD, and butyric acid, acetyl-CoA,
            FAD, and NAD+ for the testing of BCD, while varying the concentration of purified beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
            dehydrogenase and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase respectively. With a spectrophotometer, we then measured the
            rate of change of the concentration of the reactant NADH to determine the activity of the protein.
            For the results, we expected the rate of change of NADH's concentration to increase along with the rise of
            the concentration of beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This would confirm
            that the proteins encoded by our DNA constructs, HBD and BCD, could successfully upregulate the production
            of butyrate.

            After confirming the increase of butyrate, we further planned to test the relationship between butyrate and
            the upregulation of Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression. We plan to treat HCT cells, also known as human
            colorectal carcinoma cell lines. HCT cell lines are used because the microbiome in the colorectal cells
            absorbs butyrate.

            Our experiment results serve to prove the viability of our project. By combining our experimental results
            with our hardware designs (which includes fermentation kit and other relative contents), we can truly put
            our project into practice, implementing our ideas as a practical and efficient way for individuals to combat
            vitamin D deficiency.
