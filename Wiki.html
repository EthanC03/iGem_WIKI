            Abstract
        </h2>
        <p>
            From regulating calcium homeostasis, strengthening the immune
            system, and even preventing COVID-19 infection, vitamin D serves a
            crucial role in the maintenance of human health. Vitamin D
            deficiency, a global pandemic caused largely by the lack of sunlight
            exposure, has only exacerbated during COVID-19 lockdown. However,
            all current solutions to vitamin D deficiency present limitations in
            efficiency or accessibility. Our project presents a new method for
            vitamin D activation. By manipulating the acetyl-CoA butyrate
            producing pathway, we can increase the butyrate-producing ability of
            probiotics. The increased production of butyrate would upregulate
            Vitamin D receptor expression by increasing the activity of the TGFÎ²
            pathway, which would ultimately result in a more efficient
            activation of vitamin D. By introducing our engineered probiotics
            into fermented food starters, we believe the project could be
            implemented in daily diets, opening up opportunities for a more
            efficient way of vitamin D intake in the future.
