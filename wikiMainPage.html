                    In the history of mankind, vitamin D has always served
                    a crucial
                    <br>
                    role in the maintainance of human health.

                    <br>

                    The Problem
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Vitamin D deficiency, a global pandemic caused largely by
                    <br>
                    the lack of sunlight exposure, exacerbated during COVID-19
                    <br>
                    lockdowns.
                    <br><br>
                    However, all current solutions to vitamin D deficiency
                    <br>
                    present <b> limitations in efficiency </b> or <b> accessibility.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Due to these limitations, we came up with an innovative idea 
                    <br>
                    that presents a new method for <b> vitamin D activation.</b>

                    Theory
                </h3>    
                <p>
                    By manipulating the acetyl-CoA butyrate producing pathway,
                    <br>
                    we can increase the butyrate-producing ability of probiotics.
                    <br><br>
                    The increased production of butyrate would upregulate 
                    <br>
                    vitamin D receptor expression by increasing the activity of the 
                    <br>
                    TGFÎ² pathway, which would ultimately result in a more 
                    <br>
                    efficient activation of vitamin D.
                    <br><br>
                    By introducing our engineered probiotics into fermented food
                    <br>
                    starters, we believe the project could be implemented in daily 
                    <br>
                    diets, opening up more opportunities for a more efficient way
                    <br>
                    of vitamin D intake in the future.
