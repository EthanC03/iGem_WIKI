                    From regulating calcium homeostasis, strengthening the
                    immune
                    system, and even preventing COVID-19 infection, vitamin D
                    serves
                    a
                    crucial role in the maintenance of human health. Vitamin D
                    deficiency, a global pandemic caused largely by the lack of
                    sunlight
                    exposure, has only exacerbated during COVID-19 lockdown.
                    However,
                    all current solutions to vitamin D deficiency present
                    limitations in
                    efficiency or accessibility. Our project presents a new
                    method
                    for
                    vitamin D activation. By manipulating the acetyl-CoA
                    butyrate
                    producing pathway, we can increase the butyrate-producing
                    ability of
                    probiotics. The increased production of butyrate would
                    upregulate
                    Vitamin D receptor expression by increasing the activity of
                    the
                    TGFÎ²
                    pathway, which would ultimately result in a more efficient
                    activation of vitamin D. By introducing our engineered
                    probiotics
                    into fermented food starters, we believe the project could
                    be
                    implemented in daily diets, opening up opportunities for a
                    more
                    efficient way of vitamin D intake in the future.
