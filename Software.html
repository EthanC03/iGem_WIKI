            <div class="SWTxt">We created an E-commerce platform (aka online
                shopping website) as the main way to advertise and sell our
                products. Considering the ongoing pandemic in Taiwan and around
                the
                world, we choose to promote and market all of our products
                online to
                maximize their global reach in a pandemic-friendly method.
                Online
                shopping is also the most commonly utilized transaction method
                in
                the world, it has completely transformed the way people view and
                purchase goods. We believe that creating this platform can help
                us
                to reach a wider range of audiences and allow more communities
                to
                live healthier lives. Click the circle on the left to go to our E-commerce
                platform.
