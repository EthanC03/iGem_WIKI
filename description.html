                What is Vitamin D?
            </div>
            <section class=DPContent>
                Vitamin D, a fat soluble vitamin, exists in two forms:
                ergocalciferol
                <br>
                (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Humans can obtain
                <br>
                vitamin D2 through consuming food sources such as mushrooms and
                <br>
                soya milk; and, D3 through animal based products such as fatty
                fish and
                <br>
                liver (Office of Dietary Supplements - Vitamin D, 2017). Vitamin
                D3 can
                <br>
                also be synthesized by the human skin after exposure to
                ultraviolet B
                <br>
                (UVB) light (280-315 nm) (Bordelon et al., 2009). UVB light from
                sun
                <br>
                rays convert 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in the skin into
                pre-vitamin
                <br>
                D3, which is then isomerized into vitamin D3 (Wacker & Holick,
                2013).
                <br>
                <br>
                In the liver, both vitamin D2 and D3 are metabolized into
                25(OH)D, the
                <br>
                inactive form of vitamin D. 25(OH)D is then converted into its
                activated
                <br>
                form, 1,25(OH)2D in the kidneys. The biological role of
                1,25(OH)2D is
                <br>
                mediated through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). VDR binds to the
                <br>
                retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimer, which then
                binds to its
                <br>
                ligand 1,25(OH)2D to form 1,25(OH)2D-VDR complex.
                <br>
                The ligand-bound VDR complex then regulates gene expression by
                <br>
                binding to the vitamin D response elements (VDRE), a sequence in
                the
                <br>
                promoter region of the target gene (Hossein-Nezhad et al.,
                2014).
                <br>
                <br>
                Vitamin D plays a pleiotropic role in the body. Research has
                shown that
                <br>
                vitamin D regulates calcium metabolism, the immune system,
                <br>
                cardiovascular system, and others. For instance, in the immune
                system,
                <br>
                1,25(OH)2D induces the expression of the gene CAMP, CD14, FN1,
                <br>
                TREM1, which are responsible for encoding proteins involved in
                <br>
                immediate response after infection (Saponaro et al., 2020).

                <br>
                vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D level <50 nmol/L) has
                    already
                <br>
                affected over 1 billion individuals around the world (Ibrahim,

                Despite no obvious symptons, around 50% of the global population

                nmol/L

                Health professionals utilize serum 25(OH)D concentrations as the
                <br>
                marker for assessing vitamin D status instead of serum
                <br>
                1,25(OH)2D concentrations since its supply is more plentiful in
                <br>
                metabolites of vitamin D in human serum. Furthermore, 25(OH)D is
                <br>
                also more stable compared to 1,25(OH)2D as it has a half-life of
                <br>
                about 15 days while 1,25(OH)2D only has up to 15 hours, making
                <br>
                25(OH)D a better clinical candidate for determination of vitamin
                <br>
                D status(Thacher & Clarke, 2011). However, while it is most
                <br>
                widely used for clinical measurements, recent studies have
                <br>
                suggested this method as unreliable since it is 1,25(OH)2D that
                <br>
                interacts with Vitamin D receptors(VDR) and induces gene
                <br>
                expression. Thus, the ratio of 1,25(OH)2D to 25(OH)D (“Vitamin D
                <br>
                activation ratio”) makes a much better indication for
                <br>
                determining vitamin D status in the human body (Thomas et al.,
                <br>
                2020).
                <br>
                <br>
                While there are several causes of deficiency, the most common
                <br>
                reasons are the lack of exposure to sunlight and absorption of
                <br>
                vitamin D from day-to-day diets (Holick, 2021).
                <br>
                Without sufficient amounts of vitamin D, individuals start
                <br>
                developing symptoms such as bone density loss, vulnerable
                <br>
                immune system, and fatigue. Vitamin D deficiency also has strong
                <br>
                associations to numerous chronic diseases, including bone
                <br>
                metabolic disorders, tumors, and diabetes (Wang, et al 2017).
                <br>
                In adults, vitamin D deficiency may worsen illnesses such as
                <br>
                osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures. In children, lack of
                <br>
                vitamin D can increase the chance of developing rickets, a rare
                <br>
                bone disease that can cause bone pain, soft bones, and bone
                <br>
                deformities (Vitamin D Deficiency, 2020; NHS Choices, 2018).

                Acetyl-CoA is the pathway that most butyrate-producing bacteria
                species
                <br>
                use to produce butyrate. As a result, it is the preferred
                pathway for our

                project (Vital et al., 2014).
