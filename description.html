                    What is Vitamin D?
                </div>
                <section class=DPContent>
                    Vitamin D, a fat soluble vitamin, exists in two forms:
                    ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin
                    D3).
                    Humans can obtain vitamin D2 through consuming plant-based
                    food
                    sources such as mushrooms and soy milk; and, D3 through
                    animal
                    based products such as fatty fish or liver (Office of
                    Dietary
                    Supplements - Vitamin D, 2017). Vitamin D3 can also be
                    synthesized by the human skin after exposure to ultraviolet
                    B
                    (UVB) light (280-315 nm) (Bordelon et al., 2009). UVB light
                    from
                    sun rays convert 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in the skin
                    into
                    pre-vitamin D3, which is then isomerized into vitamin D3
                    (Wacker
                    & Holick, 2013).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the liver, both vitamin D2 and D3 are metabolized into
                    25(OH)D, the inactive form of vitamin D. 25(OH)D is then
                    converted into its activated form, 1,25(OH)2D in the
                    kidneys.
                    The biological role of 1,25(OH)2D is mediated through the
                    vitamin D receptor (VDR). VDR binds to the retinoid X
                    receptor
                    (RXR) to form a heterodimer, which then binds to its ligand
                    1,25(OH)2D to form 1,25(OH)2D-VDR complex. The ligand-bound
                    VDR
                    complex then regulates gene expression by binding to the
                    vitamin
                    D response elements (VDRE), a sequence in the promoter
                    region of
                    the target gene (Hossein-Nezhad et al., 2014).

                    Vitamin D plays a pleiotropic role in the body. Research has
                    shown that vitamin D regulates calcium metabolism, the
                    immune
                    system, cardiovascular system, and others. For instance, in
                    the
                    immune system, 1,25(OH)2D induces the expression of the gene
                    CAMP, CD14, FN1, TREM1, which are responsible for encoding
                    proteins involved in immediate response after infection
                    (Saponaro et al., 2020).

                    Announced by the NIH (National Institute of Health) as a
                    global
                    pandemic, vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D level <50
                        nmol/L)
                        has already affected over 1 billion individuals around
                        the
                        world (Ibrahim, et al 2020). Despite no obvious
                        symptoms,
                        around 50% of the global population has vitamin D
                        insufficiency issues (serum 25(OH)D level of 50 ~
                    <75nmol/L)(Holick

                    50-74

                    Health professionals utilize serum 25(OH)D concentrations as
                    the
                    marker for assessing vitamin D status instead of serum
                    1,25(OH)2D concentrations since its supply is more plentiful
                    in
                    metabolites of vitamin D in human serum. Furthermore,
                    25(OH)D is
                    also more stable compared to 1,25(OH)2D as it has a
                    half-life of
                    about 15 days while 1,25(OH)2D only has up to 15 hours,
                    making
                    25(OH)D a better clinical candidate for determination of
                    vitamin
                    D status(Thacher & Clarke, 2011). However, while it is most
                    widely used for clinical measurements, recent studies have
                    suggested this method as unreliable since it is 1,25(OH)2D
                    that
                    interacts with Vitamin D receptors(VDR) and induces gene
                    expression. Thus, the ratio of 1,25(OH)2D to 25(OH)D
                    (“Vitamin D
                    activation ratio”) makes a much better indication for
                    determining vitamin D status in the human body (Thomas et
                    al.,
                    2020).

                    <br>
                    While there are several causes of deficiency, the most
                    common
                    reasons are the lack of exposure to sunlight and absorption
                    of
                    vitamin D from day-to-day diets (Holick, 2021). Without
                    sufficient amounts of vitamin D, individuals start
                    developing
                    symptoms such as bone density loss, vulnerable immune
                    system,
                    and fatigue. Vitamin D deficiency also has strong
                    associations
                    to numerous chronic diseases, including bone metabolic
                    disorders, tumors, and diabetes (Wang, et al 2017). In
                    adults,
                    vitamin D deficiency may worsen illnesses such as
                    osteopenia,
                    osteoporosis, and fractures. In children, lack of vitamin D
                    can
                    increase the chance of developing rickets, a rare bone
                    disease
                    that can cause bone pain, soft bones, and bone deformities
                    (Vitamin D Deficiency, 2020; NHS Choices, 2018).

                    Known for regulating mineral metabolism, bone growth, and
                    calcium absorption, vitamin D shares several strong bonds
                    with
                    biological actions during immunomodulation (Clarke, 2009).
                    Recent studies even suggest possible associations between
                    the
                    biological actions of vitamin D and protection against
                    COVID-19.
                    This includes the immunomodulatory effects of innate and
                    adaptive immune systems, reduction of viral entry in the
                    kidney
                    and lungs, as well as protective effects against possible
                    COVID-19 associated kidney injuries (Charoenngam et al.,
                    2021).
                    Although vitamin D supplementation’s potential in combating
                    severity and intensity of COVID-19 has not yet been
                    confirmed,
                    increasing amounts of scientific experimentations support
                    the
                    claim. With COVID-19 on the roll, increasing and maintaining
                    vitamin D serum levels is without a doubt beneficial in
                    minimizing the damage caused by this disease (Charoenngam et
                    al., 2021).

                    One of the most common solutions to combat vitamin D
                    deficiency
                    is by taking vitamin D supplements. For children, these
                    supplements boost bone growth and muscle density. For
                    adults, it
                    improves both bone and mental health while combating
                    prevalent
                    issues like depression. This form of treatment, however, is
                    a
                    short-term solution. Also, since children often lack
                    awareness
                    towards the benefits of supplements/medication, convincing
                    them
                    to take supplements daily/regularly may prove to be a
                    challenge
                    in many households. Furthermore, with amnesia caused by
                    diseases
                    such as Alzheimer's, there is a high chance for
                    adults/elders to
                    forget to or over take their medication/supplements. If
                    patients
                    do not take their pills regularly, their serum 25(OH)D

                    Known as another alternative towards solving vitamin D
                    deficiency, UVB light therapy utilizes UVB rays to penetrate
                    the
                    skin in order to increase conversion of 7-DHC into vitamin
                    D3.
                    During the treatment, patients enter a room equipped with
                    UVB
                    lamps. UVB rays will then initiate vitamin D metabolism,
                    further
                    increasing the patient's serum vitamin D level. Despite this
                    therapy’s advantage in combating vitamin D deficiency,
                    several
                    dermatologists argue that at-home UVB light treatment should
                    not
                    be implemented due to its perceived high risk, including
                    skin
                    cancer, loss of skin elasticity, and eye problems. Also,
                    incorrect usage of UVB light lamps may induce gene damage
                    and
                    mutation (Bhutani & Liao, 2010).

                    Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid synthesized by
                    probiotics
                    in human guts. It increases VDR expression in a time and

                    dependent manner through the activity of the TGFβ pathway
                    (Apprato, 2020).
                    With the increased binding activity, VDR raises the
                    efficiency
                    of the activation of vitamin D and therefore utilizes more
                    of
                    the vitamin D the human body consumes.

                    According to past research that assessed the butyrate
                    metabolic pathway by measurement of intracellular pathway
                    intermediates in recombinant Escherichia coli, the pool size
                    measurement and thermodynamic analysis showed the step
                    converting Crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA as the rate-limiting
                    step of the acetyl-CoA butyrate synthesis pathway (Fischer
                    et al., 2010). As a result, we identified the bcd-etfAB
                    gene, which encodes for butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, as our
                    gene of interest.
                    <br>
                    The experiment also proves that the step converting
                    acetoacetyl-CoA to (3S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is the
                    rate-limiting step among the first three steps of the
                    acetyl-CoA butyrate-producing pathway (from acetyl-CoA to
                    Crotonyl-CoA) (Fischer et al., 2010). We, therefore, also
                    target the hbd gene, which encodes for
                    beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase.

                    Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid synthesized by
                    probiotics in human guts. It increases VDR (Vitamin D
                    Receptor) expression in a time and dose dependent manner
                    through the activity of the TGFβ pathway (Apprato, 2020).
                    <br>
                    Compared to the half-life of 25(OH)D (15 days), the
                    half-life of the activated form, 1,25(OH)2D (15 hours) is
                    relatively short. In the human body, 1,25(OH)2D is degraded
                    and metabolized often before it is even utilized to exert
                    downstream effects on certain genes, wasting activated
                    vitamin D.
                    <br>
                    The upregulation of VDR increases the binding activity
                    between VDR and the 1,25(OH)2D that would have been wasted
                    otherwise. Increased binding activity will allow for the
                    expression of certain health-related genes , thus helping
                    the human body perform processes such as the regulation of
                    the immune system and calcium homeostasis.

                    <br>
                    To achieve our goal, we insert the target genes into the
                    target probiotic. The hbd/ bcd-etfAB genes would result in
                    the expression of beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/
                    butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, therefore increasing the rate of
                    butyrate production.
                    <br>
                    Finally, we incorporate the resulting butyrate producing
                    bacteria in the fermented food of countries worldwide to put
                    our idea into practice.

                    When we first started as an iGEM team, our team started
                    brainstorming ideas about what kind of topics we would feel
                    passionate about. Looking at different research papers and
                    recent studies about a wide range of topics and taking
                    inspiration from other iGEM teams, we found a paper about
                    “golden rice,” a genetically modified food. This Golden rice
                    project from 1999, although had several ethical oppositions,
                    still managed to help children in around 16 countries combat
                    vitamin A deficiency (Genetically Modified Organisms: The
                    “Golden Rice” Debate). Therefore, after deep consideration,
                    our team also decided to dedicate our project to something
                    just as great, to help out others. And so, we came up with
                    the inspiration to do a project also related to vitamins,
                    which came to be vitamin D.
