          We work at National Taiwan University's Synthetic Biology and
          Biofabrication Laboratory under professor Hsuen-Chen Wu. Classfied as
          Biosafety Level 1, the laboratory is supervised by laboratory workers
          and is only appropriate for agents that pose minimal threat to people
          and do not cause disease in healthy adults. Specifically, we work with
          safe and common bacteria strains including E Coli Nissle 1917,
          DH5Alpha, and BLR21(DE3).
          <br />
          <br />
          Under the supervision of a trained lab technician and following
          detailed safety guidelines, we treat all chemical solutions and
          laboratory microbes with caution. All wastes from our experiments are
          autoclaved or chimically disinfected before disposal; all equipment in
          the lab is carefully, respectfully, and mindfully handled.

          <b>Bacteria Strain</b>
          <br />
          The biological systems we use to test our project is E. Coli Nissle
          1917, DH5Alpha, and BLR21(DE3). Classified as Risk Group 1 (DMS-6601)
          by the official German Central Commission for Biological Safety, EcN,
          BLR and DH5Alpha do not cause disease in healthy adult humans and
          would pose no or little risk to an individual or the community even if
          they escaped the lab (Midtvedt, 2009: Safety/Risk Groups -
          2019.Igem.Org, 2019; Risk Groups, 2015). The bacteria wastes after
          experiments are autoclaved or chemically disinfected before disposal.

          <b>Safety of Probiotics</b>
          <br />
          Probiotics have an extensive history of health-related applications
          largely related to the health and diversity of the human gut
          microbiome. The risk of adverse effects is low and only poses harm to
          people with severe illnesses or compromised immune systems. The common
          dosage of probiotics varies with different strains, but no evidence
          has suggested any potential harm from higher dosages.
          <br />
          The probiotics we incorporate in our project include E. Coli Nissle
          1917, which is one of the therapeutically applied E. Coli strains that
          have been most thoroughly investigated (Midtvedt, 2009).
          <br />
          <br />

          <b>Safety of Butyrate</b>
          <br />
          Butyrate benefits our gastrointestinal health with its
          anti-inflammatory characteristic and enhancement of intestinal mucosal
          immunity. Although some researchers argue that butyrate promotes
          obesity, most other studies have refuted the theory (Liu et al.,
          2018).
          <br />
          The dosage recommendation for butyrate is about 150–300 mg per day.
          However, since the epithelial and colon cells already have a high
          demand for butyric acid as the source of energy, users do not have to
          worry about consuming excessive amounts of butyrate when taking our
          product.
          <br />
          Moreover, the safety level, as well as the absence of side effects,
          were proved in the clinical trials of oral drug administration, which
          demonstrates that no side effects or other adverse reactions were
          observed even when the dosage is significantly (4 or 6 times) higher
          than the recommended dosage (Banasiewicz et al., 2020).
          <br />
          <br />

          <b>Safety of Fermented Food</b>
          <br />
          According to Dr. Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard
          School of Public Health, “most societies worldwide have included
          fermented foods as part of their diets” (Harvard Health Publishing,
          2018). Assimilated into individuals’ daily diets, fermentation foods
          come in all different forms— from kimchi, kombucha, pickles to yogurt,
          tempeh, and sauerkraut. Recent studies have shown that fermented food
          has multiple benefits for human health. For example, one eating
          fermented foods starting from a younger age is more likely to train a
          diverse, high tolerance, and healthier microbiome as gut microbes
          remain relatively stable after a certain age. With high quantities of
          probiotics in fermented foods, it could strengthen the intestine walls
          and prevent them from leaking by creating a healthier mix of microbes
          in the human gut. Furthermore, common bacteria types found in
          fermented food, such as Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) also synthesize
          vitamins and minerals which could all present potential benefits to
          the human body (Şanlier et al., 2017).
