          We made various presentations to educate the public on topics related
          to Vitamin D as well as information regarding our project. There are 3
          versions total: advanced, general, and Chinese. These different
          versions were created for specific audiences in mind, including people
          of different scientific backgrounds and those who speak different
          languages. The advanced version provides a detailed explanation of
          vitamin D, including background information on its functions as well
          as treatment for deficiency. We also included a section about our
          project with information about our targeted genes, pathways, protein,
          as well as a more detailed explanation of our synbio solution. The
          general version is for people younger in age with content that is less
          complex and scientific. Chinese versions are made for both the
          advanced and the general presentations. The purpose of our
          presentation is to educate the public on the basics of vitamins, more
          specifically vitamin D, in order to create a basis to introduce an
          alternative solution to vitamin D deficiency, which is our product
          “D-licious”.

        <article class="eduTextFlex">
          Our public opinion survey indicates that most people are not aware of
          vitamin D deficiency. 1055 out of the 1355 people who responded
          indicated that they don’t usually pay attention to their daily vitamin
          D intake. Furthermore, most survey respondents also indicated that
          they had little to no knowledge about the symptoms and health effects
          of vitamin D deficiency. This phenomenon proves the importance of our
          public education presentation. By educating the public on the basics
          of vitamin and deficiency, we not only raised awareness for this often
          overlooked disease, but also proved our product to be essential for
          the community.

          To promote wellness and a healthier lifestyle, we employed the use of
          our official Instagram account

          to post applicable knowledge about vitamins and health. Veering away
          from mundane knowledge present in textbooks, we included fun facts and
          puns to make the information even more engaging and memorable; complex
          information was rewritten with simple words and phrases, to help
          people understand with ease. Not only does this reach a broader
          audience, but it also helps us advertise our product in a healthy and
          efficient way.

          To put our public education presentations into practice, we gave
          online presentations at different schools and educational
          organizations in Taiwan. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19
          restrictions and the recent rise in cases, we had to give the majority
          of our presentations online. Therefore, raising awareness for vitamin
          D deficiency is extremely essential during the pandemic, because of
          the lack of sunlight and access to vitamin D-containing food.

          We held education presentations in order to emphasize the importance
          of vitamin D and improve community awareness of the issue of vitamin D
          deficiency. After reaching different groups of audiences, we feel that
          we have an influence on the audience since they do not seem to have a
          lot of knowledge about the problem of vitamin D deficiency. Showing
          that we have properly educated them to learn more about it and become
          more aware of the issue.

          Since most elementary students do not have the ability or knowledge to
          understand the science of vitamin D and its deficiency, we focus more
          on teaching them the knowledge that can be applied to their daily
          life, for example, foods that have a significant amount of vitamin D.

          Yong An (永安) Elementary School is a public school located in Taipei,
          Taiwan. Through Google Meet, we got a chance to talk to the 6 graders
          about Vitamin D using our Chinese presentation during their morning
          self-study session. The teacher wanted the students to learn some
          English vocabulary, so we also incorporated some English into our
          presentation.

          students and the parents about Vitamin D using the general & Chinese
          version presentations. Moreover, we also introduce iGEM to them,
          encouraging them to join next year’s competition.

          Thus, we build onto the simplified version by adding more explanation
          of our project. For example, how increasing butyrate can enhance the
          number of vitamin receptors. Through this presentation we want
          students to learn how essential vitamin D is to human health, and gain
          trust in our project.
