            Our HBD was not synthesized as a composite part, therefore it was obtained directly from E.coli Nissle
            1917 strain (EcN). To construct the HBD expression plasmid, primers possessing the restriction enzyme
            sites EcoRI and XhoI were used to amplify the HBD gene via PCR from EcN genomic DNA. The HBD gene was
            inserted into pET28a.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, the BCD gene, as a composite part, was designed using Benchling. The BCD gene
            sequence was obtained from the genomic DNA of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The BCD gene, flanked by
            restriction sites EcoRI and SpeI, was synthesized by Twist Bioscience and was inserted into pSB1C3 via
            BioBrick Assembly.

            We then transformed engineered pET28a and pSB1C3 into E.coli DH5ùõº competent cell separately. The
            bacterial strains were cultured in Luria Broth medium, including kanamycin for pET28a, chloramphenicol
            for pSB1C3. After using colony PCR to test the success of transformation, the plasmids were extracted
            using Miniprep and inserted into BLR(DE3) competent cells since DH5ùõº does not acquire the T7 promoter
            system. The culture was subsequently left to grow overnight in LB medium for protein expression assay.

            Since pET28a is a lac operon inducible system, we added IPTG into our bacterial culture to induce protein
            expression. We set the IPTG induced culture as the experimental group, while uninduced and culture as
            negative control; the wildtype culture was included in the negative control group to prevent leaky
            expression from the lac operon. For the BCD construct, since lac operon was not present, we set the
            engineered culture as the positive control, while wildtype culture as negative control.
            <br />
            <br />
            We lysed our culture by heating the sample. Both HBD and BCD protein were purified using nickel column
            chromatography. The concentration of the protein was determined using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of
            280 nm.

            In order to confirm that butyrate is able to upregulate VDR, we treated HCT cell lines with various dosages
            of butyrate to quantify VDR protein expression. Sodium butyrate was dissolved in PBS. The dosage of butyrate
            ranged from 0mM (PBS only) to 3mM, with a constant leap of 0.5mM. The HCT cell lines were cultured in DMEM.
            The medium of culture was replaced every day.

            We left HCT cells to grow in a medium containing butyrate for 48 hours. The cells were then harvested,
            washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed by heating. Protease inhibitors were added to prevent protein degradation.
            The lysate was then sonicated, centrifuged, and quantified using Bio-Rad protein assay.
            <br />
            <br />
            After quantification, the lysate was again analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The band at 48kDa was identified and
            quantified using Bio-Rad Image software. The experiment procedure was repeated three times. The datas were
            used for modeling efforts.
